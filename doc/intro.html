<p>SQLG is preprocessor and library that combines best ideas of JDBC, SQLJ and iBATIS to simplify writing DB access code
    for small and medium-sized applications. It is intended for use under JDK 1.6 or later (its first version was for
    earlier JDK releases).

<p>Advantages:
<ol>
    <li>Simple to use from a DB-centric point of view - it makes you write DB code in Java just as easy as in PL/SQL or
        similar languages (well, slightly more verbose :)), not losing advantages of Java language. SQLG adds concept of
        row type present in PL/SQL-like languages to JDBC calls.
    <li>Everything is in plain Java sources, so your IDE will be pleased (you can easily refactor code without worrying
        about synchronization with non-java sources).
    <li>Checks your SQL statements at preprocess-time, so SQL syntax errors won't go into runtime.
    <li>Absolutely no need for XML descriptors.
    <li>Very small (its runtime library is currently about 130 kilobytes) and has no external dependencies.
</ol>
